   *
   *   • `fov`              — vertical field of view in degrees.
   *   • `near` / `far`     — perspective frustum bounds.
   *   • `defaultDistance`  — camera-to-orbit-target distance along

   *     `CameraController.configureForScore` may *increase* this
   *     value so the full staff-spread fits vertically in the FOV.
   *
   *   • `pitchDegrees`     — vertical angle from horizontal at which
   *     the camera looks DOWN at the page in the YZ plane.  Combined
   *     with `chaseRatio`, this controls the overall 3D pitch the
   *     camera ends up at.  Useful values:
   *       45° — what the app uses now; the camera looks down on the
   *             page at the same angle it sits in front, putting the
   *             playhead near the centre of the screen with the
   *             upcoming bar laid out diagonally toward the top.
   *       30° — earlier mid-pitch reference; flatter look that puts
   *             the staves nearly parallel to the screen.
   *       25° — cinematic low-angle look; very side-on, score sits
   *             in the lower 2/3 of the screen.
   *       <halfFov — degenerate; the screen TOP looks above the
   *             horizon (sees the dark void), not just empty floor.
   *             Avoid going below ≈ fov/2 + 1° unless you actually
   *             want a visible horizon line in the frame.
   *
   *   • `chaseRatio`       — fraction of the auto-fit distance that
   *     the camera sits *behind* the playhead in world X.  Its main
   *     visual role is rotating the music X-axis on screen:
   *       0.25 — earlier setup; chase ≈ d/4 keeps music X nearly
   *             parallel to screen X (notes flow left-to-right).
   *       0.60 — earlier reference where the chase offset was 60% of
   *             the auto-fit distance.
   *       1.00 — what the app uses now; the chase offset equals the
   *             auto-fit distance (capped at the 3.0-absolute-units
   *             ceiling in `CameraController.snapToTarget` so wide
   *             orchestral scores don't fly off-axis).  Music X then
   *             projects strongly toward the top-right corner —
   *             upcoming notes appear to flow in diagonally with
   *             pronounced forward perspective.
   *
   *   • `lookAheadSeconds` — how far ahead of the current audio time
   *     the camera looks while its position still follows the current
   *     playhead.  The original SceneKit demo used 1.5 beats of
   *     look-ahead; 0.5 s is the same ballpark at moderate tempos
   *     without pushing the active notes too far behind centre.
   *
   *   • `contentHeadroom`  — multiplier on the score's vertical
   *     spread when computing the auto-fit camera distance.  Lower
   *     values pack the score tighter against the FOV (more pixels
   *     per note); for a single-staff piece this can drop below 1.0
   *     because the staff-line height alone leaves plenty of FOV
   *     margin.  When the auto-fit distance falls below
   *     `defaultDistance`, the controller clamps to `defaultDistance`
   *     so a single-staff Twinkle doesn't end up zoomed-in inches
   *     from the noteheads.  Together with `pitchDegrees` this is
   *     the primary "how close does the camera sit to the page?" knob.

   *     gets 0.3× this so the camera doesn't crash through the
   *     paper.
   *   • `orbitSpeed`         — base phase advance (rad/s).  At
   *     0.15 the primary yaw cycle is ≈ 9 s long; activity speeds
   *     it up to a hard cap of 2× during the densest passages.
   *   • `zoomStrength`       — peak fractional radius wobble.  0.10
   *     means the camera occasionally pulls 10 % closer or backs
   *     10 % off; lower values feel more like Hollywood handheld,
   *     higher start to feel like a TV-zoom.
   *   • `activityDecaySeconds` — exponential-decay time-constant
   *     for the activity counter.  ≈ 2.0 s lets a sudden run of
   *     16ths build up a few seconds of energy that fades away
   *     before the next phrase.
   *   • `biasStrength`       — 0..1, how much the camera leans

   * Directional key-light shadow quality.  All shadow-map tuning knobs

   *
   * The trickiest tradeoffs revolve around `barLineWidth = 0.02` —

   *
   *   • `mapSize` × frustum extents → texel size.  At the default
   *     6144² over a 40×30 frustum, one texel is ≈0.0065×0.0049 world
   *     units, so a 0.02-wide bar line covers ≈ 3 texels — comfortably
   *     above the temporal-aliasing threshold even before texel
   *     snapping (`_updateKeyLight`) and PCF smoothing kick in.
   *     Dropping to 4096² leaves the bar covering only ≈ 2 texels,
   *     and the shadow can flicker depending on which texel boundary
   *     the line lands on as the camera pans.  Bumping to 8192² is
   *     possible if you want even crisper shadows; cost is ≈ +2 ms
   *     per frame on Sylvia-Suite-sized scores.
   *
   *   • `radius` (PCF Soft kernel size).  This *softens* the shadow
   *     edges by averaging samples in a multi-texel neighbourhood.
   *     If the kernel radius exceeds the shadow's own width the
   *     filter washes out thin shadows: with a 0.02 bar-line shadow
   *     and a `radius = 3` kernel (≈ 0.02 world units at 6144²) the
   *     shadow's contribution is diluted by ≈ 4× and the line reads
   *     as faint smudge rather than a clean shadow.  `radius = 2`
   *     keeps the soft penumbra without overwhelming thin features.
   *
   *   • `normalBias` offsets the depth-comparison sample point along
   *     the receiving surface's normal to combat shadow acne.  The
   *     offset must stay *smaller* than `notationDepth = 0.003` —
   *     otherwise the bias can push the sample completely past a
   *     thin caster and report "lit" for what should clearly be in
   *     shadow.  0.002 leaves enough margin for both anti-acne and
   *     thin-geometry coverage.
   *
   *   • `bias` is a constant depth offset that combats the same
   *     acne.  Less negative is gentler — too-negative values can
   *     also cause "Peter Panning" where the shadow appears
   *     detached from the object.  -0.0003 is the smallest value
   *     that still suppresses acne on the metallic notehead
